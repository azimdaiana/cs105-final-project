Final Project for CMSC105: Medieval Math Mayhem \
by Grace A & Daiana A &  Monica D

This game is designed for elementary-aged children to practice arithmetic operations in a fun and interactive way. 
The player begins in a maze with a hidden path leading to an exit located somewhere in the last row. The goal is 
to find and follow this hidden path to escape the maze.

Along the journey, players may encounter guards blocking their way. To pass, they must correctly solve a math 
problem presented by the guard. A correct answer lets the player continue along the path. However, if the answer 
is incorrect, they are sent to the dungeon, ending the game.

To run the game: $ python3 UI.py
-> dependencies: blessed, pillow (ASCII art)
