Your start time is Thu May  8 19:09:21 2025
Choose how you would like to play the game: 
1. Progress through pre-built maps (map1 -> map5)
2. Generate a random map.
3. Load a saved game

Your choice: 1

Your selected map has the following dimensions: 3x3
You are currently trapped in a castle and must find your way out. To move, you must choose a direction (north, south, west, or east) to move 1 unit.
However, beware of the guards positioned throughout the castle. They might challenge you to a battle!

Reminder, this is what your maze looks like:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Find a path through the castle using the commands! 7s will represent your carved path.
You will start at the top left corner of the maze.
