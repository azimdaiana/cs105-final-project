Your selected map has the following dimensions: 3x3
You are currently trapped in a castle and must find your way out. To move, you must choose a direction (north, south, west, or east) to move 1 unit.
However, beware of the guards positioned throughout the castle. They might challenge you to a battle!

Reminder, this is what your maze looks like:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Find a path through the castle using the commands!
You will start at the top left corner of the maze.
0 0

What would you like to do? (move/save): move
Which direction would you like to go? (north/south/east/west): east

Moved a unit east.
Your current location is (1, 0) and current progress map is [[7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].

What would you like to do? (move/save): move
Which direction would you like to go? (north/south/east/west): south
